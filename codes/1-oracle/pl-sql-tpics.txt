PL/SQL exceptions

instead of tigger:
it allows you update the data in tables via their view which can't be modified directly through DML statements
when you try to apply insert, update or delete type of DML statements on an non-updatable view, oracle generally issues an error. 
If that view has an "instead of" trigger, it will automatically skip the DML statement and execute other DML statements instead.
Note: 
1. this trigger is fired for each row of the view that is gettng modified.
2. this trigger is created for a view ONLY. you can't create this trigger for a table.
syntax:
create or replace trigger <tiggername>
instead of {insert|update|delete}
on view_name
for each row
begin
end;
