React JS:
	Root component:
		App.tsx

	bootstrapper (start-up) file:
		index.tsx

			a. called the root component, which returns a React Element containing application design
			b. fetch the placeholder HTML element (a div) from HTML file
			c. treated that placeholder as a root element for React JS, by calling createRoot() method from 'react-fom/client' package and passing the HTML element
			d. called the "render" method of that root element (of type Root) and passed the React element as returned by root component

			Note: the "render()" method of the root (of type Root) creates HTML elements from the React element as returned by the root component. 	this technique is known as "mounting".
